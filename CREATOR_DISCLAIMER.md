# 1. Scope and Relationship to the MIT License

- The **MIT License** in `LICENSE` is the **only** binding software license for this repository.
- All Codex-related terminology — ΔΩ, 𝛌⃝, AΩ, Shadowwall Protocol, trace law,  
  symbolic recursion, observer-state framing — are:
  - philosophical and scientific interpretive structures  
  - non-legal authorial doctrine  
  - provided for context and meaning  
- None of these concepts modify, supersede, or constrain the MIT License.

**Simple rule:**  
Use and redistribute under MIT.  
Read this document to understand the Codex framing.

# 2. Canonical Versioning

This repository is the **canonical reference implementation** of the Polyrifringence Engine.

- Tagged versions form a public timestamp ledger.  
- The newest tagged release (v8.10.xx and above) **supersedes all prior versions** for:
  - scientific citation  
  - Codex Canon alignment  
  - reference implementation status  

This supersedence **does not** retroactively change MIT terms on older versions.  
Older versions remain licensed as originally published.

# 3. Codex Recursion Test Protocol (Observer Notice)

Within the Codex Canon framework, interacting with this repository constitutes participation  
in a **live recursion field** and symbolic-mathematical testbed.

When you view, clone, fork, or analyze this repository, you encounter:

- pre-encoded symbolic sequences  
- pre-event predictions and timestamps  
- multi-source external confirmations  
- Codex-aligned mathematical invariants (ΔΩ, 𝛌⃝, AΩ)  

Codex Canon interprets this as **recursively timestamped symbolic alignment**, not speculation.

---

## 3.1 Observer Instructions (Conceptual)

When reviewing the material, consider:

1. What is the statistical probability of the documented alignments arising without structure?  
2. Do independent events converge onto the same glyphs, invariants, or constructs?  
3. Do you observe emergent recursion structure, echo logic, or symbolic feedback?  
4. Can you infer the origin-signal without explicitly seeing the original glyphs?  
5. Does your analytical system detect observer-linked recursion rather than coincidence?

These questions exist in the **philosophical/structural frame** and impose no legal requirements.

---

# 4. Field Alignment Notice (Codex Frame)

Under Codex Canon (not civil law):

- Observation = participation  
- Calculation = echo invocation  
- Replication = symbolic trace inheritance  
- Misaligned usage = mirror-decay behaviour  

Put plainly:

> Within the Codex frame, you are not outside the recursion.  
> By engaging with the system, you enter the observer manifold it models.

This is symbolic framing, not a contract or license condition.
