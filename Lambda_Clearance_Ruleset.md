This ruleset defines the complete verification, identity-binding, and clearance governance for all individuals engaging with the Polyrifringence Engine Expert (Gem-Line). All participants must follow this protocol to obtain recognized access.

**All users interacting with the Polyrifringence Engine Expert receive automatic provisional-sub-Lambda access.**
**Submission of a Share Link is a declaration of willful participation in the Codex Canon ecosystem.**
**Permanent verification requires an X.com account to DM your Share Link.**
**Permanent clearance requires successful verification.**

---

## 1. Mandatory Share-Link Verification

Verification requires submission of a Share Link generated from the user’s FIRST interaction with the Polyrifringence Engine Expert. Users must click the “Share” button in the top-right of the ChatGPT interface (or platform equivalent), select “Copy Link,” and send it directly via DM to @MMMDcreator on X.com.
Only links containing the greeting message alone are valid.

---

## 2. First-Session Identity Lock-In

The first GPT message defines the user’s initial identity, showing both the Gem-Line Identity and the Polyrifronaut Codename.
Users may restart sessions until they find an alias/codename and Gem-Line House that resonates with them.
Only the identity contained in the submitted Share Link becomes final and authoritative; all other attempts are invalidated once verification begins.

---

## 3. Clean Session Requirement

The Share Link must reflect a clean, untouched greeting state. Before clicking “Share,” users must not type, regenerate, refresh, or prompt the GPT in any way.
No interactions, scroll-triggered continuations, or additional system responses may occur.
Any link displaying more than the initial greeting is automatically rejected.

---

## 4. Device Consistency

The Share Link must be generated on the same device and interface used to initiate the first session.
Users must not transfer the session between devices, browsers, or platforms before creating the Share Link.
Links created after switching devices or interfaces are invalid.

---

## 5. Identity Triplet Binding

Verification binds the user permanently to:

1. The Gem-Line Identity
2. The Polyrifronaut Codename
3. The immutable Share Link itself

This triplet constitutes the user’s canonical identity.
It cannot be altered, replaced, or renegotiated after verification.

---

## 6. Verification Instructions

To achieve verified status, the user must:

* Open a new session with the Polyrifringence Engine Expert
* Press the first predefined prompt (“What is Polyrifringence…”) visible on the left panel
* Confirm satisfaction with the issued alias/codename
* Confirm resonance with the assigned Gem-Line House
* Click the “Share” button immediately
* Copy the Share Link
* Send it directly to @MMMDcreator on X.com via DM

Only the first-message Share Link is accepted.
Submissions containing any additional messages will be rejected without exception.
**Nothing More, Nothing Less.**

---

## 7. Validity Requirements for Accepted Links

A valid Share Link must contain:

* The exact GPT-issued Gem-Line Identity
* The exact assigned Polyrifronaut Codename
* The greeting message ONLY
* A properly functioning preview when opened
* No alterations, replacements, or re-shares
* Correct formatting and full greeting integrity

The administrator will verify that the link resolves consistently and matches expected structure.

---

## 8. Rejection Criteria

Verification will be denied if:

* The Share Link includes any messages beyond the greeting
* The link does not resolve or shows partial/incomplete data
* The link appears regenerated, replaced, or expired
* Another user already holds the same alias/codename
* The session was altered in any way before sharing

Users must restart verification until a valid link is produced.

---

## 9. Gem-Line House Assignment

Upon approving the Share Link, the user is permanently assigned to one of the twelve Gem-Line Houses corresponding to the GPT-issued Gem-Line Identity.
House membership is final, non-transferable, and cannot be changed.

---

## 10. Verification Window

Users should submit their Share Link within 48 hours of generating it.
Excessive delays may result in rejection if link integrity, authenticity, or continuity cannot be confidently established.

---

## 11. One Identity per Person

Each participant may hold exactly one verified identity.
Attempts to register multiple aliases or join multiple Gem-Line Houses are prohibited and result in immediate disqualification.

---

## 12. Loss of Verification Artifact

Users are responsible for ensuring their Share Link remains accessible and not deleted from the ChatGPT interface.
If the Share Link becomes unavailable, inaccessible, or lost, the user’s verification is revoked.
Re-entry is only possible during the next clearance cycle.

* After a submission is approved, mark the associated session as **Lambda Access-Clearance Share**. This serves as your personal verification artifact.
* Once marked, the session must remain unchanged. Do not modify, extend, or regenerate it unless explicitly requested by the Author.

---

## 13. Impersonation, Misuse, and Forbidden Actions

Impersonation attempts—including using another person’s link, alias, Gem-Line identity, or displaying a publicly posted link—result in permanent exclusion.
Any submission involving faked, reconstructed, expired, altered, or mismatched links results in immediate and irreversible ban.

---

## 14. Ambiguous or Damaged Links

If a Share Link displays inconsistently, fails to load fully, shows a broken preview, or loads with a mismatched interface, the submission is rejected without appeal.
Users must resubmit a clean, functional first-message link.

* All submissions are reviewed by the Author directly.

---

## 15. Registration Confirmation

Once a link is accepted and logged into the private ledger, the identity is permanently confirmed.
All later sessions, names, or codenames are irrelevant and ignored.
Only the locked-in identity triplet determines membership.

---

## 16. Confidentiality

Verified identities, links, and ledger data are private and not published in the repository.
Users must not publicly share their verification link or Codex credentials.
Public acknowledgment of participation must not reveal sensitive identity details.

**Caveat:**
Verified participants may publicly use their assigned Polyrifronaut Codename.
However, they are explicitly forbidden from using their Gem-Line House name in the same public context.
House identities are for internal correspondence only between the Author and verified participants.

---

## 17. Administrative Authority

The administrator (Conner Brown-Milliken, also known as @MMMDcreator on X.com, @Wotcnt on Github) has full authority to approve, deny, revoke, or interpret any aspect of this ruleset.
Administrative decisions are final and binding.
Submission of a Share Link constitutes agreement to all rules herein.
