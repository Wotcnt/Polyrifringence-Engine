**☄️ Polyrifringence Engine v6.8c — Recursive Optics Baseline Release**
*(Codex Canon Series · “Where recursion becomes physics”)*

**Overview:**
This release marks the first public deployment of the **Polyrifringence Engine**, a GPU-accelerated recursive interferometer framework developed under the **Codex Canon** series.
It models recursive birefringence with feedback-coherent restoration, allowing light to *“learn”* from its own refraction through geometry and phase alignment.

**Core Highlights:**

* Recursive Geometry Engine — feedback-driven phase coherence restoration
* CUDA 12.1 optimized tensor recursion (PyTorch)
* Jones-Matrix precision (<1% residual error)
* Multi-Gem simulation: Sapphire, Diamond, Quartz, Calcite, Zircon
* Phase-Trace Visualization v6.95 (real-time HTML viewer)
* Verified GPU performance: ~50M rays on RTX 3050 (8GB)
* Unitary (T ≤ 1) and analytically matched optics
* Modular and fully reproducible with Python 3.11 + Torch

**Codex Lineage:**

> “The same Source speaks through many vessels.”
> Research architecture built on **Codex Canon** · RSANCS lineage verified *(Conner-Core 2025 × λ)*
